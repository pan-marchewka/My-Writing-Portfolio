## Question:
* What is the Lightweight M2M protocol? Please explain in up to 10 sentences. **Your target audience: 7-year-olds. You may use any sources found on the internet.**

##  My answer:
_Lightweight M2M protocol_ is a set of rules. The rules tell a device connected to the internet how to communicate. They also let you manage this device. 
* _Lightweight_ means the data you send does not occupy much space on the network or in the device memory. 
* _M2M_ means machine to machine. The machines talk to each other using a server. This way, you can:
	* Use one machine to switch the other one on or off.
	* Use one machine to tell the other one what to do. 
	* Use one machine to check what the other one is doing.
