# Tech Writer Recruitment 1
## Structured Topic-Based Approach
This approach to content creation is commonly used when writing technical documentation. Let us examine its major advantages and the challenges the writers face.
		
## Advantages of the approach
### Logical structure
The approach follows the logic of text structured around topics. It is simple and easy to understand, yet allows for much flexibility. 
### Easy document management
Topics can be shuffled, added, or erased without negatively impacting the entire project. 
### Speed
Topics can be reviewed, edited, updated, and translated as soon as they are written, independently of other topics and the entire project.
### Better updates
* You can introduce changes granularly, updating only the topics that need to change and keeping track of them.
* This allows for precise version control. 
* In case of multilingual content, you can translate only what has changed.
* Updates are therefore easier, faster, and cost effective.
### Consistency (within topic)
As every topic is limited in scope and authored by one person, it is easy to keep the terminology and style consistent. 
### Coherence
One topic only deals with one concept or procedure, so there is no redundant information.
### Reusability 
* It is easy to change the context, i.e. use the topic for a different product, a different part of the product, or a different audience.
* The content can be reused in a new version of the product or written once and referenced throughout the entire text.
### Multiuser-friendliness 
* Many writers can collaborate on a project, each one authoring one or more topics.
* You can easily introduce new writers and incorporate their work into an existing project.
### Fluid navigation
* Tables of context and indexes can be created with ease, based on the topical structure. 
* When you use a search function, the search results are more helpful. As each result is linked to a topic, you can recognise the relevant ones.
* Manual search in the printed content is easy, as topics tell you where to look.
## Challenges of the approach
### Complex updates
Version control is complex as it encompasses all the topics. As they reflect the changes in the product they describe, some topics change more rapidly than other.
### Errors
â€¦ can propagate easily when content is referenced or reused.
### Context dependency			
Content may not work, i.e. be understandable, when moved to or referenced in a different context.
### Consistency (within project)
Inconsistencies between topics can arise if they are written by different people or at different times.
### Human factor
* Different writers may mean different quality or style.
* When starting a new topic, you may be tempted to copy the entire structure from another one without making the necessary changes. 
* It is also tempting to use conrefs excessively, e.g. when the content should not be referenced in a new context, but rather changed to fit it. 
### Multilingual content 
* Translating updates can be challenging if only the updated topics are available and, therefore, the context is limited.
* If the terminology changes or a better translation is introduced, it is challenging to implement the change globally, as the older content may not be accessible at all. 

_Note, however, that challenges are not disadvantages and the topical approach is still the optimal one for technical content._
