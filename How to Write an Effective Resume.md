# How to Write an Effective Resume
Build the first resume on the basis of a good job description, then tailor it to a specific job.

### Good job description:
* summary
* responsibilities
* qualification

	* Pay attention to keywords. Also when tailoring. Find the ones that describe you. They also help with tracking systems. But in the end, it’s humans who decide.

	* Change title when needed, but don’t lie.

### Ideal resume:
* Profile/Summary, tailor it to fit the job profile.
* Professional Experience: company, job title, date: month and year, responsibilities, but only relevant ones: what (you did), why (you did it), how (you did it), accomplishments: what did you successfully do, metrics if possible.
* Education.

### Other points
* 2 pages maximum, not 1 if you are experienced.
* 1-2 bullet points for older jobs, more for new ones.
* Black & white, photos optional.
* 5-10 last years matter.
* Show growth.
* Better self-employment than a gap.
* Ageism - most relevant, most recent (last 10 years), don’t include education years, my experience will solve your problems, is an asset.
