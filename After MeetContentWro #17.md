# After MeetContentWro #17 
## Just over a week…
… since the last MeetContentWro (#17) and just 2 weeks until the next one. #17, by **Marta Bartnicka**, the _Publishing and Localization Senior Engineer_ at Dolby Laboratories, was all about Markdown. 
* What was hot:
	* Marta put her money where her mouth was: not only the entire presentation was in Markdown, but it was also made available on Marta’s GitHub. I was especially thankful for that, as I got to the meeting late (through no fault of mine... send your regards to MPK Wrocław), but could check out everything I missed afterwards. 
	* Lots of examples! And you can practice at home with the said GitHub document.
	* More time for questions! (Compared to the previous presentations.) 
	* All in all, you can tell Marta is a professional educator! Sorry, Marta, it just shows ;-).
* What was not:
	* Nothing, really… although I must admit I was hoping for more anecdotes on how to people try to use Markdown in unpredictable ways (but it’s just me… probably). 
* What I learned:
	* There are markdown **FLAVORS**?! Say what? As somebody self-taught, it was a revelation for me (but judging from my recent experience, there are many people out there who use Markdown without knowing that).
	* A refresher on both Markdown AND GitHub was very welcome and superbly done.
	* You can incorporate Markdown documents into your workflow by using them as drafts of sorts (or, as we would say in Polish, brudnopis). 

Now I can look forward to the next presentation, by [Jan Sosna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-sosna/) and [Barbara Kardel-Piątkowska](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbara-kardel-piatkowska/) on March 22, dedicated to Simplified Technical English. 

PS Still looking for a job as a technical writer.
