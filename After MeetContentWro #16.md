# After MeetContentWro #16 
## Less than one week…
… until the next MeetContentWro which I cannot recommend highly enough! There is something there for everybody (everybody who is a technical writer or a technical writer-adjacent person, that is):

* If you are a beginner:
	* You will learn the ropes from the best in the field.
	* You will have the opportunity to ask any question that may bother you, either during a presentation or in the informal talks afterwards.
* If you are a seasoned professional:
	* It is an opportunity to learn techniques and tricks other organisations use and apply them in your job in the future.
	* If you work alone, it is good opportunity to remind yourself that you’re not and there are people out there to lean on and ask for advice. 

* And, finally, if you are someone that is right in the middle, like me (an experienced professional that has only recently entered the technical writing realm):
	* Just in the last meet-up, I learned: 
		* From **Ed Portas** presentation (and the talk we had afterwards), that not only the documentation can be treated as a product, but also tested as such, including trying out new approaches to content structure and the way it is presented.
		* From **Tomasz Prus** presentation, how to use  the _design critique_ framework (as leveraged at Atlassian) as a peer review technique to ensure the highest quality of your technical writing.

And the next presentation, on February 28, by my former boss, **Marta Bartnicka** is all about markdown. Can hardly wait!

PS Still looking for a job as a technical writer.
