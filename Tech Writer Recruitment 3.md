# Tech Writer Recruitment 3
## Question:
* On the basis of the Troll application (https://trello.com/login) prepare a comprehensive tutorial for users in which you will explain how to:

1. Create a board and name it “Shopping list”:
	1. Set a background for the board.
	2. Set its visibility to Private.
2. Invite a person to the board.
3. Add 3 lists and name them “To buy”, “Bought” and “Not bought”.
4. Add 2 cards - one named “Vegetables” and the second named “Fruit”.
	1. Add a checklist to each card with a few elements, for example for “Vegetables” - “tomato”, “cucumber”.
	2. Assign the card to the previously added board member and set a due date for this card as well as a date reminder.
5. Move the card from “To buy” to “Bought”.

## My answer:
In addition to professional applications, Trello can help with a variety of personal uses. You can, for example, use it to create a shopping list, like so:

* From the main Trello page, click the grey _Create new board_ button. It can be located near the center of the page or near the bottom, depending on your device and resolution. Or, if you are just starting with Trello, click _Create your first board_ button. _Create board_ pane is displayed. 

	1. Select the background for your new board by clicking on the desired background under the **Background** header.
	2. Next, enter the **Board title**. Let’s try “Shopping list”.
	3. From the **Visibility** drop-down list, select _Private_ to make this board visible only to you.
	4. Click the **_Create_** button. Your workspace and your new board will be displayed. 
	
* Now, let’s invite someone you are shopping with. Click the _Share_ button in the upper right corner of your new board. _Share board_ dialog is displayed. 
	1. In the field displayed, enter the email address of the person you want to invite.
	2. From the drop-down list on the right of the field you can choose whether to invite them as a Member (that can edit the board) or Observer (that can only see it). 
	3. Click the _Share_ button. You can now enter the message to the person you’re inviting, but it’s optional. Click the _Share_ button again to send the invitation.

Alternatively, you can use the **Share this board with a link** option to invite somebody with a copied link.

	4. Close the dialog, using the exit button (**X**). 

* We can now make lists for the items we are planning to buy, the ones we bought, and the ones that were not available. By default, your new board has three lists, **To Do**, **Doing**, and **Done**. 
	* Click on the **To Do** list title and enter “To buy” to rename it. 
	* Click on the **Doing** list title and enter “Bought” to rename it. 
	* Click on the **Done** list title and enter “Not bought” to rename it.

* Now, let’s plan our shopping trip:
	1. Click _Add a card_ option in any list.
	2. Enter the card title in the field provided. Let’s try “Vegetables”.
	3. Click the _Add card_ button.
	4. Now enter “Fruit” and click the _Add card_ button again.
	5. Click anywhere outside the list to finish adding cards.

We now have cards for two types of products. Let’s populate them:
	1. Click on the **Vegetables** card to open it. 
	2. From the column on the right, select the _Checklist_ option.
	3. Enter the title for the checklist in the text field or leave the default one.
	4. Click the _Add_ button.
	5. Enter the name, e.g. “tomato” in the **Add an item** field and click the _Add_ button.
	6. Repeat the step above to add as many products as you like, such as “cucumber”, etc.

Let’s send somebody shopping…
	* Click the _Members_ option under **Add to card**.
	* Select the previously invited person. Close the dialog, using the exit button (**X**). 

… and give them a deadline for buying these items:
	* Click the _Dates_ option under **Add to card**.
	* Select the date from the calendar or enter it manually under **Due date**. 
	* Set the reminder by selecting it from the **Set due date reminder** drop-down list.
	* Click the _Save_ button.

You can now close the card, using the exit button (**X**).

And, finally, when the shopping is done:
	* From the **Shopping list** board view, left-click and hold on the card (not the entire list), then move the cursor to drag and drop the card, e.g. **Vegetables**, from **To buy** to **Bought** list.
